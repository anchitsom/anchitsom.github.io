Our task was to design a product for a business which acts as a marketplace platform with a defined supply and demand side and promotes the concept of shared economy. We chose to design a business around Campus Micro-logistics and Food Delivery as it was a problem faced by us on a daily basis and we had a good understanding of user needs along with the business value of such a platfom. The time duration of the project was <b> 4 weeks. </b> </p>

							<h3 class="t-center dark f-large bold marginlil"> Analysis </h3>

							<h3 class="t-center dark f-expanded bold marginlil">Product Description</h3>

							<p class="t-left marginlil"> “Resolvd” is a hyper-local errand running and delivery service platform that matches people who need their errands completed to people willing to complete them. </p>
							<p class="t-left marginlil">Errands could include queuing to buy and deliver food to you by your next class, or delivering documents to you while you’re in the library and don’t want to give up your seat. (for this version of the application, we focus on food delivery) </p>
							<p class="t-left marginlil">Our online platform connects students within a university campus radius and allocates students who don’t have time to students who do. We plan to launch our app at the University of Hong Kong campus to create a shared economy through Resolvd: made for students, by students.  </p>

							<hr>

							<h3 class="t-center dark f-expanded bold marginlilmore">Primary Users</h3>

							<div class="row marginlil">
							<div class="col">
								<p class="t-center bold f-semi-expanded"> Busy Students - Demand </p>
								<p class="t-center marginlil">In university campuses all around the world, students are juggling between academics, clubs, part-time work, sports, relationships, etc. With so much to do in such a short amount of time, Resolvd helps connect busy students with others that can help them get tasks done, whether that be delivering food to them in class or picking up paperwork from the other side of campus. While there are other errand-running services currently available on the market, none are as hyper-local and market-specific as Resolvd. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="verticalLine">
							</div>
							<div class="col">
								<p class="t-center bold f-semi-expanded marginleftlil"> Students Need Money - Supply</p>
								<p class="t-center marginlil marginleftlil"> With the costs of university tuition and living going up every year, some students are struggling with having enough cash just to get by. The only way students can currently make money is by getting a part-time job, which forces them to work a certain amount of hours in a week and doesn’t give them flexibility in their schedule.

On the other hand, Resolvd offers students an opportunity to earn money by delivering goods and completing miscellaneous tasks whenever it’s convenient for them. </p>
 </p>
							</div>

							</div>

							<h3 class="t-center dark f-expanded bold marginlilmore">Secondary Customers</h3>

							<div class="row marginlil">
							<div class="col">
								<p class="t-center bold f-semi-expanded"> Campus restaurants </p>
								<p class="t-center marginlil">During peak pedestrian traffic around lunch time, a lot of restaurants on campus currently aren’t efficient when handling the long line of customers. This ultimately leads to impatient customers exiting the queue for faster dining options, leading to lost revenue for the business.

Resolvd would allow customers to order food whenever it’s convenient for them and not have to wait in long queues. This means that restaurants would receive a steady flow of business throughout the day, rather than hoards of students at specific times. Firms can also market their business directly to students through our app, since students can easily order food through our platform. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="verticalLine">
							</div>
							<div class="col">
								<p class="t-center bold f-semi-expanded marginleftlil"> Pedestrians </p>
								<p class="t-center marginlil marginleftlil"> By having a single errand runner performing the same task for multiple people, such as picking up sandwiches from Subway or printing out multiple documents for multiple clients, Resolvd will significantly reduce the flow of pedestrian traffic around campus. This reduction will help people get to where they need to go faster and increase overall productivity. </p>
 </p>
							</div>

							</div>

<hr>

<h3 class="t-center dark f-enxpanded bold marginlilmore">Dynamic Pricing</h3>

<p class="t-left marginlil marginleftlil"> Extensive pricing research revealed that the supply-demand is quite volatile with high demands during peak lunch hours and greater supply in non-peak hours. Thus we decided to approach a dynamic pricing approach as opposed to fixed pricing for the Resolver fees. </p>

<p class="t-left marginlil marginleftlil"> Fees for the customer will range from a <b> minimum of HKD 4 to a maximum of HKD 20,</b> depending on supply and demand. There will be an algorithm in place constantly calculating delivery fees, based on how many Resolvers are available and how many orders are placed. </p>

<p class="t-left marginlil marginleftlil"> The primary revenue stream for this business model is commission-based; thus an extra 25% of the Resolver fee will be charged as commission to the customer ordering food, however this will also be affected by the dynamic prices. Thus the <b> minimum commission we will earn would be HKD 1 and the maximum would be HKD 5.</b> </p>

<hr>


							<h3 class="t-center dark f-enxpanded bold marginlilmore">Key Customer Concerns</h3>

						<p class="t-left marginlil marginleftlil"> After conducting user interviews on product usage, some important concerns were identified -  </p>

						<p class="t-left marginlil italic marginleftlil"> <b> KCC 1.</b> How will I know whether my order will be accepted or not?</p>

						<p class="t-left marginlil italic marginleftlil"> <b> KCC 2. </b> What if the Resolving rate is too low? </p>

						<p class="t-left marginlil italic marginleftlil"> <b> KCC 3. </b> What if the Resolver/Customer never comes to the decided location? </p>

						<p class="t-left marginlil italic marginleftlil"> <b> KCC 4. </b> I can't keep on waiting for the order to be accepted. There has to be some deadline. </p>

						<p class="t-left marginlil italic marginleftlil"> <b> KCC 5. </b> Can I pay more than the rate for the Resolver to accept my order?</p>

						<p class="t-left marginlil italic marginleftlil"> <b> KCC 6. </b> How will I tell the customer that I'm available for delivery?</p>

						<p class="t-left marginlil italic marginleftlil"> <b> KCC 7. </b> What is the exact amount I will have to pay on top of the delivery?</p>

						<h3 class="t-center dark f-expanded bold marginlilmore"> Prototyping</h3>
						<p class="t-left marginlil"> Users were involved in the Design process as I drew a few rough sketches of the app in front of them to understand how elements can be placed in the app to reflect their mental model and KCCs. </p>

<p class="t-left">In the billing screen, the user can see the Resolver fees, and the Resolvd Tax, which is the amount earned by the application on each delivery. <b> (addresses KCC 7) </b> They can add an acceptance deadline such that the order appears in listing till that designated time.
