									</div>

								<h3 class="bold t-center f-semi-expanded marginlilmore">Indents Tab</h3>

									<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil"> The dynamic panel has been designed to provide relevant information to the Warehouse manager for actionable insights. <b> A top priority for the warehouse manager is to understand how many orders he/she has for the day and how many are pending. Thus the panel consists of elements like Pending Since and Pending By.</b> </p>

									<div class="row marginlil">
										<img src="images/DTS/WHM/indents.png"> </img>
									</div>
									<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil"> Here we can see the dynamic panel on the right and the corresponding list view on the left. This is a realtime view and shows the immediate state of the warehouse operations. On clicking a list entry, a hybrid list view(refer Page elements) is shown with card details such that the user can take actions based on the information provided. </p>

									<div class="row marginlil">

										<img src="images/DTS/WHM/comparison d0.png"> </img>
										<img src="images/DTS/WHM/comparison d.png"> </img>
										<p class="f-normal t-left dark"> The Show Comparison is a special feature as it allows the warehouse manager to compare his operations with a past timestamp. On clicking the “Show comparison” tab, a popup to select the timestamp shows up. The user can select a custom date and time or use the option in the frequents to see operations a day, a week or a month ago. After the user clicks on set comparison date, the indent panel transforms into a comparison panel as follows. </p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-md-8">
										<img src="images/DTS/WHM/comparison.png"> </img>
										<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil"> The value for the past timestamp is shown on the left and the realtime value is shown on the right. <b> This allows the warehouse manager to understand how his operations have fared in a given time period. This can be an hour before, 2 hours before or any other suitable time frame.</b> The comparison bar button now displays the comparison time and date along with a cross which when clicked exits the comparison mode and returns to the original panel state.  </p>
									</div>
									</div>
									<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil">Below the comparison bar are the following components-</p>
									<p class="f-normal t-left dark"> Update Window- The update window is divided into two sides, left for reflecting change in the operational numbers while the right for showing change in statistical values.
									The warehouse manager can understand exactly how many new indents have been added, and how many previously pending indents have now been placed. While the user can understand this by subtracting values shown in the panel, <b> a dedicated update window gives him the required information straightaway and makes the entire panel coherent.</b>
									<p class="f-normal t-left dark">	Percentage Progress- This shows the progress of operations in comparison to the previous date and time and the parameters can be updated by clicking the question mark.</p>

									<h3 class="bold t-center f-semi-expanded marginlilmore">Yards Tab</h3>
							 	<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil">	The Panel has been designed to provide the warehouse manager with actual numbers and time frames for the trucks present in the yard. <b> The emphasis is on helping the user understand which indents are deviating from the average values.</b></p>
									<div class="row">
										<img src="images/DTS/WHM/yard 1.png"> </img>
										<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil">	It consists of a YMS bar chart which provides the user a visual sense of how his operations are panning out by simply looking at the height of the bars in the chart. It also consists special metrics such as Gate In/GateOut Pending which shows all the trucks that have been Reported/Gated In but whose Gate In/Gate Out is pending. <b> A possible user flow could be the user clicking this element and then arranging by time elapsed to understand which trucks have been delayed the most.</b> </p>
									</div>

									<h3 class="bold t-center f-semi-expanded marginlilmore">Transit Tab</h3>
								<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil">	The Panel has been designed in a way that the <b>user understands where deviations and delays are occurring, and allows him to quickly act on it.</b> It has special metrics like Route Deviation which help analyse trends in deviations that are occuring or might occur in the future.</p>
									<div class="row">
										<img src="images/DTS/WHM/transit 1.png"> </img>
										<img src="images/DTS/WHM/transit 2.png"> </img>
										<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil">	The dynamic sections of the list entries are different from all the subtabs in the system. It does not show the last two steps but shows the expected arrival time and date along with the current location. <b> This helps the warehouse manager quickly identify where the truck is and when it will reach the yard.</b> The time elapsed is replaced by ETA deviation so that the user knows how delayed the truck is from its original time.

Note-The arrival time is displayed after adding in the ETA Deviation so that the user has realistic information of truck arrival.

											<img src="images/DTS/WHM/watchlist 2.png"> </img>
											<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil"> <b> This feature has been designed to provide a high degree of personalisation to the warehouse manager.</b> For certain specific cases or indents, the user can add any list entry to the watchlist to track it seperately. The list entries can be added to the watchlist from any of the views including the Search bar, by selecting the element and clicking on the Add to Watchlist button below the list. After clicking the button, the popup shows up. </p>
										</div>

										<div class="col-md-6">
											<img src="images/DTS/WHM/watchlist 3.png"> </img>
											<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil"> Since the watchlist addition can be from any list, the user can add a tag to remember why he/she put it in the watchlist. This tag can be used to identify the indent individually or a group of indents in the watchlist with the same tag. </p>
										</div>

									</div>


									<h3 class="bold t-center f-semi-expanded marginlilmore">Deviation Lists</h3>
									<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil">	This view helps the warehouse manager to set trigger values such that any deviations can be recorded in a deviation list for quick access. </p>

									<img src="images/DTS/WHM/dev1.png" style="max-height:500px; max-width:800px"> </img>

									<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil">	Lists can be created using any of the KPIs and can be personalised by specific transporters, warehouses or materials. </p>

									<h3 class="bold t-center f-expanded marginlilmore">Central Transport Head Dashboard</h3>

									<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil"> This mode provides a pan-India view of the operations and comparative insights into warehouse performance  (can access warehouse manager view) </p>

									<h3 class="bold t-center f-semi-expanded marginlilmore">Live Panels</h3>

										<img src="images/DTS/WHM/panelsctm1.png" style="max-height:400px; max-width:800px"> </img>


										<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil">This is the first feature that the user gets to see when he opens the application. It shows overall statistics across all operations and systems in one consolidated view. While the default view shows all operations, the user can use the Show by Filters on the left to see specific warehouse, transporter or materials.

<b> The idea behind the panels is to provide realtime information to the user about his operations, he may check the status of the live panel every hour, or every 2 hours and notice the changes in the numbers of his operations. </b>

To make the changes in the operations even more visible, there is a show Comparison with custom date option at the bottom. </p>

<img src="images/DTS/WHM/panelsctm2.png" style="max-height:600px; max-width:800px"> </img>

<h3 class="bold t-center f-semi-expanded marginlilmore">Map View</h3>

<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil"> This view has been designed for comparative analysis of the warehouse operations such that the Transport manager can see geographical trends and also pinpoint a problem. </p>

<img src="images/DTS/WHM/map view.png" style="max-height:400px; max-width:800px"> </img>

<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil"> It consists of two components, the actual map view and a control panel on the right to manipulate this map view. Each Warehouse is displayed as a grey square with a number indicating the selected property from the control panel on the left. The Warehouses are referred to by their code and the warehouse manager can find the code for any warehouse in the index placed at the bottom left of the map.  </p>
<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil"> The possible use cases for this feature are quite vast, here is an excerpt from the original Product Requirements Document - </p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">

<h3 class="bold t-center f-semi-expanded marginlil">CTM Deviation List</h3>
<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil"> The deviation list is similar to the WHM view with key difference that the user can track a group of warehouses and use warehouses as a parameter to create these lists. </p>
<img src="images/DTS/WHM/devctm.png"> </img>

<h3 class="bold t-center f-expanded marginlilmore">SCM/Logistics Head Dashboard</h3>
<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil"> The Supply Chain Manager Dashboard shares the exact same features as the CTM Dashboard however has an additional feature in place of Deviation Lists called Rulewise View.  </p>

<img src="images/DTS/WHM/ruleview 1.png" style="max-height:400px; max-width:700px"> </img>

<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil">This feature has been designed to provide the user a holistic view of how his indent rules are performing. It shows the efficiency of each cluster's operations, along with a segmented view of the performance of the transporters in the clusters. Each Cluster item is a widget which can be manipulated and toggled independently to provide relevant information about the cluster’s performance. The user can browse the clusters by going down in this list or simply search for a cluster in the search bar above </p>

<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil">In the middle the user finds information in terms of measurement metrics showing average and extreme values. This gives the user a good comparison to understand how far away from the average a particular deviation would be. The button on the extreme right “Edit in IMS” gives the user to option to directly jump into the IMS and modify the rules for the specific cluster. This CTA button is primal in allowing the user to analyse the cluster and then make changes based on it. </p>

<img src="images/DTS/WHM/ruleview 2.png" style="max-height:400px; max-width:900px"> </img>

<p class="f-normal t-left dark marginlil"> In the expanded view, details for each transporter can be seen for the user to get an in-depth understanding of the transporter’s performance. This provides a retrospective view of the operations for future planning of operations and trends analysis.(can access all views) </p>
